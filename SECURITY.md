# Security Policy

If you discover a security issue, please report it privately using GitHub Security Advisories for this repository.

Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

## File intent
- Provide a single, clear path for private vulnerability disclosure.
- Prevent accidental exposure of security issues in public trackers.
- Keep expectations aligned with [[CONTRIBUTING]].
- Keep transcription and diarization local; Personal.ai is text-only.

## Relationships
- [[README]]
- [[CONTRIBUTING]]
- [[docs/implementation-plan]]
