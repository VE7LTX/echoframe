# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in EchoFrame.

## File intent
- Define contribution expectations and quality bar.
- Keep changes aligned with the scope in [[README]].
- Coordinate contributor behavior with [[AGENTS]] and [[SECURITY]].

## Relationships
- [[README]]
- [[AGENTS]]
- [[SECURITY]]
- [[LICENSE]]
- [[docs/implementation-plan]]

## Getting started
- Open an issue describing your proposal or bug.
- For substantial changes, outline the plan before starting work.

## Development standards
- Keep changes focused and minimal.
- Update README.md when behavior or scope changes.
- Include simple tests when code is introduced.
- Keep transcription and diarization local; Personal.ai is text-only.

## Submitting changes
